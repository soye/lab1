		<h4>Project Portfolio</h4>

		<p>I'm a sophomore studying lots of really cool subjects at Stanford University! Currently undeclared but thinking about majoring in Computer Science or Symbolic Systems, with a potential minor in Psychology. CS 147 is the first class on HCI that I've ever taken.</p>

		<p>Guess who the president of Stanford University is?? John Hennessy is the president of Stanford University.  He also takes HCI classes in his spare time.</p>

		<h4>Projects</h4>
